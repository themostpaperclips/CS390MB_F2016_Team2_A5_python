# The python for A5

This is pretty minimal, really just a call to scikit-learn. I added simple unit tests to make sure things worked so if there is an error it is probably with broadcasting to the server. Make sure to change `test.py` if you change the `location_clustering.py`. Since the assignment wants me to send the labels to the server from the `cluster` function I can't do a test on it without copying it.
